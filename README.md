# Getting Started with Create React App

    1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site? 
       https://github.com/BeckyIKEB
    2. What API did you use and why? 
I used weather API because of the following common reasons:
    • It provides real-time, accurate information on current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical data.
    • It allows me to tailor the information I receive based on specific needs. For example, I specify the location, format, and type of data I want to receive, making integrating the weather information on my own built application easier.
    • It provides a straightforward way to integrate weather information into your application.
This can provide users with up-to-date information on local weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant weather data, helping them make informed decisions about their daily activities.
    3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work. 
The code uses several React Hooks, including "useState", to manage the component's state. The state includes:
    • Data about the search results.
    • The number of search results.
    • The location being searched.
    • The loading state.
    • Any errors that may occur during the search process.
The UI of the app is composed of several components, including the search input field, the search button, and the filter options. The results are displayed in a table-like format, with columns for the city, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The loading and error states are also displayed in the UI.
    4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly. 
The following considerations helps to make a website responsive and mobile-friendly. Those are:- 
    • Making the design flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes, resolutions, and aspect ratios.
    • Using a flexible grid system that adjusts to different screen sizes.
    • Ensure the images we used are optimized for different devices and screen sizes using responsive images and image compression techniques.
    • Ensuring the navigation is intuitive, easy to use, and touch-friendly on mobile devices.
    • Choosing appropriate font sizes and line heights for different devices makes the text easily readable on small screens.
    • Ensure the website is interactive and engaging on all devices, using touch-friendly elements like buttons and links.
    • Optimizing the website for fast load times on mobile devices by compressing files, reducing image sizes, and using efficient code.
    • Testing the website on different devices, browsers, and screen sizes ensures it looks good and works well on all devices.
    5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness? 
       To make the app  accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness. As a developer I do take the following things in consideration in a time of app development. Those are:
    • providing alt (alternative) for images, icons, and graphics to help them to read by assistive technologies like screen readers.
    • Make the availability of keyboard navigation and ensure the functionality of the app can be navigated using a keyboard.
    • Testing the app to ensure that all of its content can be readable and its functionality for screen readers.
    • Ensure there is sufficient color contrast between text and background colors for users with color blindness to help them to read the text easily.
    • Provide descriptions for audio for the users with visual disabilities can understand the content.
    • Adding voice control functionality in the app.
    • Putting the consideration of accessibility guidelines before making the app public to ensure the app is accessible to people with disabilities 
    6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them? 
I believe I could make improvements to the project in order to expand the experience for other users. Firstly, I would like to focus on enhancing the user interface. This could be done by conducting user research and testing to determine what changes would make the most impact. Then, based on that research, I would make the change and apply all needs.
Another area of focus would be to add additional features to the project. For example, adding the ability for users to customize their experience in specific ways or adding new content to the project to keep it fresh and engaging. Again, I would start by conducting market research to understand what features are in demand among our target audience and then work to implement those features.
Overall, my approach to implementing these changes would be to gather information and data to inform my decisions and then work to ensure that any changes are made in an efficient and user-friendly way.
